# Leaf Framework
Leaf Framework is a annotation driven framework that aims to simplify java
development and increase the productivity for the model layer issues of the MVC
(Model View Controller) based java applications. To simplify development Leaf
Framework provides declarative programming environment using annotations.
With declarative programming developers describe desired result of the
program without explicitly writing codes that need to be carried out to achieve
the results. You can still use imperative development with Leaf Framework. You
can also use declarative and imperative development together.
